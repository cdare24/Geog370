<h1>Homework 6: Census Data Choropleth </h1>
<h2>Claudia Dare</h2>
<h3>My map is a map of Florida by county where the choropleth shows the percentage of women who gave birth and were single in the past year. The map shows that there is no real association with area and women being married or single in the state of Florida. Most of the higher percentages are in the north of the state with a cluster in the lower center. However, most of these are offput by counties with low percentages surrounding them.</h3>
